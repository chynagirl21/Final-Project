			<p>Welcome to the World of Wilderness camp website.
				 This site will help you learn all about the world of camping.
				  It will also include different camping sites and outdoor activities that would be great to try in the different states of said campsites and ways on how to stay safe and also have a fun trip.</p>
			   <h3> Events</h3>
			<p>During the different states that we will be camping at we will be doing proactive events having fun in the sun! 
				Some of those events are canoeing in Lake Sinclair, mountain hiking The Great Smokey Mountains in Tennessee, rope gliding in Massachusetts and many more. 
				These activities are family friendly, fun but most of all close to nature.</p>
