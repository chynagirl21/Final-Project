		<p>Whether youâ€™re into peace and serenity or just in the mood to go out into the wild. 
            The World of Wilderness camping company is here to give you a great and safe camping experience. 
            World of Wilderness is like no other camping company. 
            We go all around the world with groups of people to teach them about camping and the wilderness. 
            Our team will scout and choose a campsite for the week of your adventure (popular and local sites). 
            The weeklong adventure will consist of introducing our guests to traditional camping activities while also exploring state specific events. 
            Our guests will enjoy activities such as hiking up mountains, canoeing and of course having bonfires.
            Our team is world traveled and safety certified.
            We understand different plant life, wildlife, and distinguishing between safe and poisonous items. 
            Our goal is to ensure a seamless, interactive, and most importantly a fun environment.
            Join us for a great time! </p>
        <p>Our Company began in 2012 and has been growing year after year.
           We started out exploring doing  small trips with our families to campsites in Georgia.
           The small explorations allowed us to learn about ways of camping safely.
           The idea of camping while enjoying outdoor activities prompt us to save up enough money to start the company now known as World of Wilderness! 
           We love to explore, to grow and to enjoy seeing the world with our guests. </p>
        <p>Through the years we have explored many states, some of the frequent states are Seattle, Arizona, Washington and many other beautiful states.
             We plan to grow into campsites around the world, some of the upcoming areas are different parts of Europe as well as places like Rome, Paris, Du Bai just to name a few. 
             We are so happy to have created a lot of great memories for all of the families we have serviced and look forward to creating those lifelong memories with more families in the future. </p>
